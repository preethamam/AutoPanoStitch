# Requirements
MATLAB <br />
MATLAB Computer Vision Toolbox <br />
MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox <br />
MATLAB Parallel Computing Toolbox <br />

# Run command
Please use the `Main_AutoPanoStitch.m` to run the program. Change the `folderPath      = '../../../Data/Generic';` to your desired folder path. Also, change the `folderName      = '';` to a valid name.

Change the hyper parameters accordingly if needed. But it is not required though.

# Note
Depending on how your images are captured, panaroma being a `spherical`, `cylindrical` or `planar` should be selected judicially using the `input.warpType` and `input.Transformationtype`. Generally, `spherical` or `cylindrical` projections with `affine` or `rigid` transformation should work well in most of the cases. However, some panoramas specifically looks good in `projective` transformation, e.g. flatbed scanner or whiteboard (`affine` works well too) images.

Currently, spherical, cyclindrical and planar projections stitching is supported in this version and can recognize multiple panoramas. This work is in progress, further improvements such as inlcusion of a full view 360 x 180 degree panoramas stitching (everything visible from a point), automatic panorama straightening, runtime speed optimization and Graphical User Interface (GUI) are under development. Your patience will be appreciated.

# Known issues
1. Bundle adjustment using the `lsqnonlin` in MATLAB is computationally slow.
2. Gain compensation on large number of images is computationally slow.
3. Due to the rigid transformation and no straightening, some of the panaromas will be skewed.

# Adaptation of open source 
Bundle adjustment functions in MATLAB are adapted from the [Kevin Luo's GitHub Repo](https://github.com/kluo8128/cs231_project) and heavily improved.

# Licensing conditions
The original implementation of the automatic panaroma stitching by Dr. Brown was written in C++ and is `LICENSED under The University of British Columbia`. This is being programmed and made available to public for academic / research purposes only. Please cite the relevant citations as provided in the main file.
